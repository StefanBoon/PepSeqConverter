# PepSeqConverter
Application to convert three letter amino acid sequences to one letter sequences and vice versa.

Paste amino acid sequence in the input text box and press convert.

- Make sure there are no none existing amino acids codes in the sequence. 
- The application will read which seperator is used in between amino acids ( - / . _ or none etc.).
- d-amino acids are not implemented yet. This application is yet not able to convert d-amino acids.
- Non natural amino acids are not implemented yet. This application is yet not able to convert non natural amino acids.
- Do not start a three lettered sequence with a seperator. (the application reads the three lettered sequence in steps by three characters; a starting seperator will shift this reading and the app will give an error.
